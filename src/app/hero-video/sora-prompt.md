# Sora Video Prompt for Light Cones

## Main Prompt
```
A breathtaking cinematic sequence showing light cones in spacetime, where beams of light form perfect cones through the fabric of space. The camera smoothly travels through an elegant visualization of Einstein's relativity, with galaxies and stars distorting as we approach light speed.

The scene transitions to show a person in a futuristic laboratory manipulating a holographic interface that controls the physics simulation. As they adjust parameters, we see light bending around massive objects and time dilation effects visualized through flowing light trails.

Then, multiple scientists from different eras appear in a sleek debate arena with cosmic backgrounds, gesturing at floating equations and models as they challenge each other's theories. Einstein and a modern physicist exchange ideas across time.

Finally, we see a knowledge sphere containing miniature simulations and historical figures, with glowing connections between related concepts. A human hand reaches out to touch the sphere, causing it to expand and reveal intricate details of spacetime physics.

Throughout the sequence, everything is rendered with a sleek, high-contrast aesthetic using deep blues, purples, and indigo gradients with occasional bright accent highlights. The lighting creates a sense of cosmic wonder and scientific discovery.

8K, photorealistic, seamless transitions, shallow depth of field when focusing on human elements, expansive depth when showing cosmic scenes.

## Alternative Variations

### More Technical Focus
```
A detailed scientific visualization of light cones in 4D spacetime. Starting with a single point emitting light in all directions through time, forming a perfect cone structure. The camera zooms out to show multiple light cones intersecting and creating causal relationships across spacetime.

We transition to a professional physicist working with advanced equipment, adjusting precise instruments that measure relativistic effects. Holographic displays show numerical data and mathematical equations as parameters change. Light paths visibly bend around simulated massive objects.

In a modern conference setting, diverse scientists engage in spirited debate, using augmented reality to project competing models of physics. They manipulate equations that float between them, highlighting contradictions and proposing solutions.

The scene shifts to an advanced knowledge visualization system where quantum physics, relativity, and alternative theories are mapped in a complex three-dimensional network. A researcher navigates through this structure, highlighting connections between seemingly disparate concepts.

The visuals maintain scientific accuracy while using a clean, minimalist aesthetic with deep space colors (navy blues, rich purples) and precise, thin lines of light tracing physical phenomena.

8K resolution, photorealistic rendering, precise scientific visualizations, technical UI elements, documentary-style composition.

### More Artistic/Conceptual Approach
```
An artistic interpretation of spacetime as a flowing fabric, with light forming perfect cones that stretch and distort through the medium. The visualization begins abstract, with geometric patterns evolving into recognizable cosmic structures as we pull back through layers of reality.

A silhouetted figure stands before an enormous wall of light, their hands conducting an orchestra of physics - as they gesture, particles flow and time bends in beautiful, flowing patterns. The boundaries between art and science blur in this elegant dance of concepts.

In a surreal landscape where the sky is filled with equations rather than stars, figures from throughout scientific history gather on floating islands, each representing different theoretical frameworks. They reach across impossible gaps, trying to connect disparate ideas.

The sequence culminates in a vast library where books transform into pure knowledge - streaming light that forms a living neural network connecting all physical concepts. A single conscious observer moves through this network, causing ripples of illumination wherever they focus their attention.

The entire sequence uses a dreamlike color palette dominated by deep indigos, ethereal purples, and occasional bursts of brilliant white light, all rendered with painterly textures and fluid transitions between scenes.

8K, artistic rendering with photorealistic elements, impressionistic lighting, flowing camera movements, magical realism aesthetic.

## Usage Instructions
1. Submit the main prompt to Sora first
2. If the results need more technical detail, try the Technical Focus variation
3. If a more abstract/artistic approach is desired, use the Artistic/Conceptual variation
4. When satisfied with generated video, implement it using the VideoBanner component

## Integration Notes
- Video should be hosted at a high-quality but compressed for web
- Format should be MP4 with H.264 encoding
- Consider a lower-resolution fallback for mobile devices
- Add appropriate alt text describing the video for accessibility
